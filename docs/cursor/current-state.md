# Current State

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created DeepInfra API integration with Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct model
- ✅ Implemented model switching functionality in the UI
- ✅ Updated all pages to use the model from session state
- ✅ Added automatic detection of GPU availability
- ✅ Implemented default model selection based on system capabilities
- ✅ Fixed model loading sequence to prevent null reference errors
- ✅ Updated documentation and project files
- ✅ Implemented two-step approach for more accurate data extraction:
  - Vision model (Llama-3.2-90B-Vision) for image analysis and raw text description
  - Text model (Meta-Llama-3.1-8B) for parsing the raw text into structured JSON data
- ✅ Moved API key to environment variables for security
- ✅ Created centralized configuration system
- ✅ Added deployment configurations for Render and Vercel
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Improved text extraction from raw model responses
- ✅ Integrated Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct model as more reliable alternative
- ✅ Implemented 3-way model selection (Phi-4, Llama-3.2, LLaVA) with improved UI
- ✅ Set Microsoft Phi-4 as the default model for better reliability and cost efficiency
- ✅ Updated all documentation with new model options and configuration parameters

## In Progress

- 🔄 Testing with different types of store images
- 🔄 Fine-tuning prompt templates for optimal results with all three models
- 🔄 Performance optimization for faster analysis
- 🔄 Implementing more robust text-to-JSON extraction logic
- 🔄 Cloud deployment testing with the new model configuration
- 🔄 Comparative analysis of model performance (Phi-4 vs Llama vs LLaVA)

## Pending

- ⏳ Implementation of caching mechanism for faster repeated analysis
- ⏳ Enhanced error recovery for intermittent API failures
- ⏳ Addition of more sample images for demonstration purposes
- ⏳ Developing more sophisticated fallback extraction methods for when JSON parsing fails
- ⏳ Adding authentication for the deployed application
- ⏳ Implementing image caching to reduce API costs

## Known Issues

- Error handling for network connectivity issues could be improved
- UI sometimes flickers briefly during model switching
- The two-step approach increases the number of API calls, which impacts cost and performance
- Vercel deployment requires special configuration due to Streamlit's requirements
