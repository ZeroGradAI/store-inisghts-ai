# Current State: Store Insights AI

## Project Status: In Progress

This document tracks the current state of the Store Insights AI project, including completed tasks, in-progress work, and known issues.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Refactored inference.py to use LLaVA model instead of MiniCPM/Phi
- [x] Updated model references throughout the codebase
- [x] Created README.md with setup instructions and project overview
- [x] Updated requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- [x] Created feature-design.md with detailed architecture description
- [x] Ensured backward compatibility with existing app structure
- [x] Implemented proper image processing for the LLaVA model
- [x] Implemented response generation and parsing from LLaVA output
- [x] Maintained fallback mechanism for systems without GPU
- [x] Fixed import paths to properly include the LLaVA directory
- [x] Updated documentation to include LLaVA repository setup instructions
- [x] Fixed import error for LlavaLlamaForCausalLM by adopting the eval_model approach
- [x] Made integration more resilient to different versions of the LLaVA repository
- [x] Created custom llava_utils.py with subprocess approach to avoid import issues
- [x] Modified LLaVA __init__.py to handle missing classes gracefully

## In Progress

- [ ] Testing full application functionality with various image types
- [ ] Optimizing inference performance for faster analysis
- [ ] Exploring the creation of sample images directory for testing

## Known Issues

- The application requires a CUDA-compatible GPU with sufficient memory for optimal performance.
- LLaVA model needs to be installed from the local repository first.
- Response parsing is dependent on the model output format, which may change with different prompts or model versions.

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with a variety of retail store images
2. Create a sample image directory with test images
3. Consider fine-tuning the model on retail-specific data
4. Add unit tests for critical components
5. Add error handling for edge cases
