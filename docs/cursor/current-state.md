# Current State

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created DeepInfra API integration with Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct model
- ✅ Implemented model switching functionality in the UI
- ✅ Updated all pages to use the model from session state
- ✅ Added automatic detection of GPU availability
- ✅ Implemented default model selection based on system capabilities
- ✅ Fixed model loading sequence to prevent null reference errors
- ✅ Updated documentation and project files
- ✅ Implemented two-step approach for more accurate data extraction:
  - Vision model (Llama-3.2-90B-Vision) for image analysis and raw text description
  - Text model (Meta-Llama-3.1-8B) for parsing the raw text into structured JSON data

## In Progress

- 🔄 Testing with different types of store images
- 🔄 Fine-tuning prompt templates for optimal results with both models
- 🔄 Performance optimization for faster analysis
- 🔄 Implementing more robust text-to-JSON extraction logic

## Pending

- ⏳ Comparison metrics between Llama and Llava model performance
- ⏳ Implementation of caching mechanism for faster repeated analysis
- ⏳ Enhanced error recovery for intermittent API failures
- ⏳ Addition of more sample images for demonstration purposes
- ⏳ Developing more sophisticated fallback extraction methods for when JSON parsing fails

## Known Issues

- The DeepInfra API key is currently hardcoded in the inference_llama.py file
- Error handling for network connectivity issues could be improved
- UI sometimes flickers briefly during model switching
- The two-step approach increases the number of API calls, which impacts cost and performance
