Store Insights AI

The app is meant for store managers to better manage their stores. They have multiple-cameras in the store 
from whose video feed we would take a snapshot of the store every X minutes and then draw various insights

For the purposes of the demo, it would just be images instead of a video feed.


Now create a simple web app for demo using streamlit/gradio for now. The app should have two modules - Gender Demography, Queue Management and then a main dashboard.

1. In each of the two modules, there should be an option for users to upload the images.
2. Now for the gender demography module, the user would upload an image of an area where users are browsing the products (could be grocery, clothes etc) and click on submit,
The model should now analyze the image, and show the count the number of men and women in the image and  also give a general description of what products are the customers looking at if possible.
3. For the Queue Management module, the user would upload an image of a top view of the billing counters, and click on submit.
The model should now analyze the image, and show a count of the total counters, how many are open and closed, if any particular counter is over crowded and then suggest to start billing in a new
counter if available.
4. In the main dashboard, it should show a general summary of the two modules, whereever the image has been uploaded and inferred.


Please refer to this code for the model inference and other things etc : https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/blob/main/web_demos/minicpm-o_2.6/chatbot_web_demo_o2.6.py

Once the code is setup, i will push this to github as i do not have cuda on my local machine to run the model. I will then import it to the Pytorch Lightning Studio hub with a GPU
to launch the same.
